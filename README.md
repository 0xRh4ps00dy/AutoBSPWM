## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions

### Shell stabilisation

- **py_tty_upgrade**: Copies a Python one-liner to the clipboard that spawns a better interactive shell (PTY).
- **py3_tty_upgrade**: Same as above but for Python 3.
- **script_tty_upgrade**: Alias that copies a TTY upgrade command using the `script` tool to the clipboard.
- **tty_fix**: Fixes your terminal after exiting an interactive shell session (restores line discipline).
- **tty_conf**: Copies your current `stty` settings to the clipboard so you can restore them later.


### URL Encode/Decode

- **urlencode()**: Encodes a string into a URL-safe format using Python and the `pwn` module.
- **urldecode()**: Decodes a URL-encoded string using Python and the `pwn` module.

### Fuzzing

## üß∞ Scripts

All in **scripts**:

- **[ligolo_script](https://github.com/0xRh4ps00dy/AutoBSPWM/blob/main/scripts/ligolo_script.sh)**: this script auto-discovers your VPN IP, sets up a dedicated TUN device for Ligolo traffic, prints out all the commands you need to run on client and server sides (and even copies the subnet-route command to your clipboard), then starts the Ligolo proxy itself.
- **[multihandler](https://github.com/0xRh4ps00dy/AutoBSPWM/blob/main/scripts/multihandler.sh)**: this script automates spinning up a Metasploit multi/handler listener for a reverse-shell payload.
- **[penelope.py](https://github.com/brightio/penelope)**: is a powerful shell handler built to simplify, accelerate, and optimize post-exploitation workflows.
- **[transfile.sh](https://github.com/0xRh4ps00dy/AutoBSPWM/blob/main/scripts/transfile.sh)**: this script detects your machine‚Äôs IP, then prints out a ready-made list of commands‚Äîtailored for Windows and/or Linux‚Äîto download or upload a file. It finishes by hosting that file via `python3 -m http.server` so you can fetch it from a remote system.
- **[target.sh](https://github.com/0xRh4ps00dy/AutoBSPWM/blob/main/scripts/target.sh)**: this script resets and rebuilds your `~/.ctf_vars` file with the VPN IP, target IP, workspace paths, and useful aliases; ensures your VPN is up; configures UFW to trust the target; creates a clean folder structure for a new CTF box; and then drops you into Zsh with everything preloaded. Remember reload every term you have opened with `source ~/.zshrc`.

## üìå Notes

- Ensure you are using an Kali Linux system.
- Fonts from `fonts` should be installed manually or via the script.
- Feel free to customize the `sxhkd` or `polybar` configs.
- Some shortcuts, aliases or functions require install some applications more. I didn't installed them because I wanted a fast installation.
